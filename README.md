# crypto_prediction_builder
Maintains a database of historical pricing data, builds out features to be used for ML models, trains those ML models, and logs predictions to csv file.

MAIN FUNCTION DOES THE FOLLOWING IN ORDER:\
  -UPDATES DATABASE (CURRENTLY JUST BITTREX DATA, MORE EXCHANGES WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE)\
  -REBUILDS FEATURE SETS (CURRENTLY JUST FOR LINEAR REGRESSION, FUNCTIONS NEEDED FOR INPUTS FOR LSTM TRAINING)\
    -THIS IS WHERE YOU PUT THE FEATURES YOU WANT BUILT, THERE ARE ONLY A FEW BASIC EXAMPLES IN THE BUILDER FUNCTIONS
  -REBUILDS MODELS \
  -UPDATES PREDICTION LOGS (CURRENTLY JUST OUTPUTS TO CSV FILES, MORE EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES TO COME)\


***\
-IGNORE FORECASTER FOLDER\
-PROGRAM IS JUST A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING PREDICTIVE ML MODELS AT SCALE\
-MODEL/FEATURE BUILDER HELPER FILES CONTAIN FUNCTIONS FOR A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FORECASTING AT VARIOUS PERIODS\
-NEW TECHNIQUES (LIKE LSTM NETWORKS) CAN BE ADDED INTO THESE HELPER FUNCTIONS AND RAN FROM THE MAIN PREDICTION BUILDER FILE\
***\

Improvements to come in the near future:\
-requirements.txt file\
-ability to pass arguments from command line\
-Accurate prediction log\
-Improved graphing options\
-Application to show graphs and easier see results\
